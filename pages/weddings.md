<h1>Music for Weddings and Civil Partnership Ceremonies</h1>  
<p>Opera dâ€™Amici love singing at special occasions, and what could be more special than your wedding service or civil partnership ceremony ? If you would like a soloist at the ceremony itself we have many to fit the bill, and a lot of experience in helping to choose the right piece for your big day.</p>
<p>Entertaining the family and guests at the wedding breakfast is something we are very comfortable doing too. With a selection of popular and well known opera classics accompanied live at the piano (which we can provide), you can be sure there will be something for everyone.</p>
