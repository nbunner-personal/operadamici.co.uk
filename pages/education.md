<h1>Education</h1>
<p>Opera d'Amici is involved in many outreach programmes.  Hannah and her team have devised a series of workshops for schools that link into the National Curriculum and these have proved very popular. They are very varied and it is best to call for details, but they can be over a single day or several weeks, be singing skills only or Opera / Music Theatre. This involves set design, creating costumes, devising an accompaniment and most especially dancing, acting and singing for children.</p>
