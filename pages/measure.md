<h1>Made to Measure Music</h1>  
<p>Opera dâ€™Amici has an extensive repertoire, as well as a large pool of singers, superb pianists and musicians of all sorts at our disposal.</p>
<p>If you want an orchestra, we can provide it. If you would like a small band of musicians we can arrange that too. If all you have room for is a singer and backing tracks then we will of course do that for you, but most often people opt for up to 5 singers with one of our incredible pianists with the skills to make opera accompaniment really come to life !</p>
<p>The Made to Measure service is about getting exactly what you want. We will guide you through the programme choices and advise you on which singers would best suit.</p>
