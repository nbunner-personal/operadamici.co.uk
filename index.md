Founded in 2001 by Hannah Kirk for a fully orchestrated and staged production of La Boheme, Opera d'Amici is an opera company of friends sharing their love and passion for what they know to be the best job in the world.

Opera d'Amici doesn't just sing with orchestra, they more usually perform with a pianist in a variety of venues such as garden marquees, village and church halls, hotels and restaurants.  They specialise in producing tailor made programmes taken from a very broad repertoire and a series of ["Off the Pg"](/what-we-do/opera-off-the-peg.html) titles especially designed to make [corporate and private events](what-we-do/corporate-events.html) planning easier.

Hannah has drawn highly experienced singers from companies such as Welsh National Opera, Scottish Opera, English National Opera, Covent Garden, Opera International, Carl Rosa and D'Oyly Carte.  They all have the best time singing together on projects big and small and their enjoyment is very infectious!

Combining mobile facilities with experienced singers, the client can be sure of a professional service that can be flexible to their performance needs.  But most importantly of all, they can be sure that they will have a really great time!
